# Template for SOAP Automation projects

A project template for SOAP automation projects.  
To achieve this, it's used JAX-WS Maven Plugin to import the WSDL's, and CXF for configure the service client.  
The project dependencies also contain JUnit and AssertJ, which are optional and can be removed and replaced by any other asserting/test frameworks.  

Inside the project there are examples on how to use it to automate services.
